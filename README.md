# 0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

This repository contains solutions for the project "0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO" as part of the low-level programming curriculum at [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/). The project focuses on implementing and understanding the concepts of stacks and queues, and their respective behaviors: LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) and FIFO (First-In-First-Out).

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- Gain a deeper understanding of the stack and queue data structures.
- Learn how to implement a stack and a queue using arrays and linked lists.
- Understand the differences between LIFO and FIFO.
- Implement common operations on stacks and queues, such as push, pop, enqueue, and dequeue.
- Explore practical applications of stacks and queues.

## Project Contents

The repository contains the following files and directories:

- **monty**: This directory contains the source code files for the Monty interpreter. The interpreter reads Monty bytecode files and executes the operations specified in them using a stack or queue data structure.
- **tests**: This directory contains test files used to verify the correctness of the Monty interpreter.

## Usage

To use the Monty interpreter:

1. Compile the source code:
   ```
   gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o monty
   ```

2. Run the Monty interpreter with a Monty bytecode file:
   ```
   ./monty file.m
   ```
   Replace `file.m` with the path to your Monty bytecode file.
